                    <p>
                <a href="https://ginger.io/">Ginger.io</a> is a startup based in San Francisco that delivers mental health care through an app. The company contracted me and <a href="http://www.sarakoay.com/">Sara Koay</a> to investigate their providers’ current working environment and recommend changes to improve the user experience and workflow. Our recommendations were also intended to consider how to increase the providers’ response times and allow them to care for higher numbers of members. Furthermore, the company wanted us to investigate if a mobile experience would be an appropriate addition to the providers’ desktop-based work environment. 
                The project aims to learn about the providers’ working domain and user requirements, assess the appropriateness of a mobile experience for them, and use any findings to design and validate an appropriate digital experience. </p>
                <p style="font-size:16px"><em>To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information. The information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of Ginger.io.</em></p>

                            <li><strong>BACKGROUND RESEARCH.</strong> Research into the industry mental health care apps and UX methodologies.</li>
                            <li><strong>WORK DOMAIN RESEARCH.</strong> Research into the work practices of Ginger.io's employees.</li>

                  <br>  <h4>Challenges</h4>
                <p>As this was a project spanning three months with a remote client, there were several constraints we had to operate within. The main challenges were:</p>
                 <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                        <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>REMOTE CLIENT AND USERS.</strong> As we were conducting this research from St Andrews and our client was in SF, we had to consider appropriate methodologies for testing with their employees.</li>
                            <li><strong>CONFIDENTIAL CONTENT.</strong> As Ginger.io's providers work with sensitive and protected content, it limited the extent of our observation.</li>
                            <li><strong>CURRENT SYSTEMS.</strong> Any designs we made had to easily compliment the Ginger.io app and the system(s) the providers use as part of their care. Meaning, the learning curve could not be too steep as to disrupt their workflow.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                   <br> <h4>Approach</h4>
                    <p>Our approach to the project centred on two things:</p>
                      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                        <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>RESEARCH.</strong> The approach to this project has a high weight on research, as to gain insights into the user base. Research was conducted to inform the design, and then research was conducted on the design to ensure it works (also called the "research sandwich" by <a href="http://leahbuley.com/">Leah Buley</a>).</li>
                            <li><strong>AGILE/LEAN.</strong> Towards the end of our research analysis, we began to employ an increasing Agile approach to the design and prototyping phases. This was due to time constraints as the project had to wrap soon. In this regard, we began adapting our approach to impending changes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div></div>
                   <br> <h4>Work</h4>
                    <p>As this project is still wrapping up, I am not able to exhibit the insights and designs from our work.</p>

                <h3>STAAR Tours</h3>
                <p>The aim of this project was to design a networks-based system that could benefit Scottish tourism. My group, consisting of 4 members, came up with an app concept that allowed Scottish tourists to play an augmented reality (AR) game that guided them to different historical landmarks. The app, STAAR Tours, augments the view of Scottish landmarks as part of an educational game for traveling students. The concept was delivered in a combination of an informational website, a video marketing and demoing the app, and a working prototype of the application.</p>
                <br><br>

                <div class="bodytext">
                   <br> <h4>Role</h4>
                   <p>As our group's output was a combination of many items, I took responsibility for the designs and concept video for the app. This required me to look into the state of the art AR and apply features to the game concept. </p>
                   <br> <h4>Background</h4>
                   <p>Our project had to consider the implications of implementing an AR app. This lead us to investigate relevant benefits and challenges to implementing AR technology.
                    <br><br>The primary benefits of the use of AR with tourism are:</p>

                    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                        <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>EXPERIENCE HISTORY.</strong> With augmented visuals, it is possible to recreate buildings, statues, pictures or other artefacts that are no longer complete. Tourists can view the augmentation with a head-mounted display or mobile device.</li>
                            <li><strong>CUSTOMISABLE EXPERIENCE.</strong> AR can help enhance the interaction between user and destination and users can tailor the content to their preferences. AR experiences are customisable and can be individualised by users in terms of what is shown, what order and the duration.</li>
                             <li><strong>LOCATION.</strong> Location-based information can be provided as users move within a defined area. Location can easily be gathered by QR codes, ports, or exact geospatial location. This is particularly useful with city tours because AR can be used to guide visitors to different important locations within a city.</li>
                            <li><strong>GAMIFICATION.</strong> AR can be gamified in order to create a fun and engaging experience. The ability to augment a view creates many different possibilities for game concepts.</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12">
                 <br><br><p>The main challenges to implementing AR are:</p>
             </div>

                    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                        <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>IGNITING CONSUMER INTEREST.</strong> The largest challenge to implementing an AR app is the current lack of customer hyper over mobile AR.</li>
                            <li><strong>DEVELOPMENT &amp; MAINTENANCE COSTS.</strong> The use of proprietary AR platforms such as Wikitude, Aurasma and Layar are expensive, possibly prohibitively so to small companies and organisations.</li>
                             <li><strong>UNKNOWN COMMERCIAL VALUE.</strong> Despite the interest and enthusiasm of developers to create AR solutions, little is known about the commercial success of the apps or consumer response to such projects. It has been suggested before that smaller, particularly non-corporate AR projects, tend to struggle more due to lack of user interest, limited application and/or limited resources.</li>
                            <li><strong>RELIANCE ON NETWORK.</strong> A lot of mobile AR relies on some kind of internet connection (mobile or WiFi) and/or GPS. Unless users are signed up to a mobile plan that allows them to roam affordably, developers would have to be mindful of where users can go when designing each location's application.</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
          
                   <br> <h4>Design</h4>
                   <p>The wide range of requirements gave the design of the game some considerations when striking a balance between creating a unique and memorable experience, whilst meeting the needs of the userbase.
                    <br><br>The primary features available in mobile AR include:
                   </p>
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                        <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>LOCATION-BASED TECHNOLOGY.</strong> Content delivery that is based on a user's geolocation.</li>
                             <li><strong>2D IMAGE RECOGNITION.</strong> Content delivery based on the in-camera view.</li>
                              <li><strong>INTERACTIVE OVERLAY AND ONSCREEN ELEMENTS.</strong> In-camera or screen content that is selectable or navigable.</li>
                               <li><strong>MARKERS.</strong> Content delivery based on a defining marker.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                 <div class="col-md-12">
                 <br><br><p>The design process therefore considered the AR elements that would be part of the game and how each screen would look on the mobile app. When designing the interface screens, I  built on the game concept that another member proposed. Designs were made in Sketch and GIMP and animated in Keynote.</p>
                 </div>

                   <br> <h4>Game</h4>

                   <p>The game enlists the user as an agent that is given a mission to defeat a time- travelling criminal. In order to defeat the criminal, the agent must go to historical Scottish landmarks and correct the historical facts that the criminal has disturbed. In order to correct history, the agent must point their camera at the landmark and the correct historical facts will appear in view. They will then be asked to answer a question about the landmark in order to move on to the next one. After they have completed the quizzes at all the landmarks, they complete the game by correcting history and banishing the criminal. The purpose of the game is to be fun and educational while guiding the users through a city. The game is best suited for cities that can be toured on foot.

                 <h3>Peruse</h3>
                <p>As part of a User-Centred Design module, I was teamed up with three colleagues to research and design an app called Peruse. We were matched with a client wishing to implement the app concept and listened to their vision for the app while also factoring in our own research. The app, Peruse, is a two-sided (for shoppers and shop owners), location-based product search engine that matches shoppers with products near them. The products are listed by the local businesses (shop owners).</p>

                <div class="bodytext">
                    <br><h4>Role</h4>
                    <p>As this was a group project, all members collaborated on the research and analysis evenly. Once the design stages started, the team split between the two sides of the app (shopper and shop owner), with me and another member focusing on the shopper-facing app. This involved sketching ideas and user journeys, creating elements in Sketch, protoyping screens in InVision, and animating screens in Keynote for our final presentation.
                    </p>
                    <br><h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <p>The group faced two main challenges while carrying out this project:
                    </p>
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                        <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>START FROM SCRATCH.</strong> As we were handed this project without any prior research, ideas, designs, or technology, we had to carry out domain research and build system requirements from the ground. This research was  guided by the pitch of the app concept from our client.</li>
                             <li><strong>THREE MONTH TIME CONSTRAINT.</strong> As each phase of the project was held to a strict deadline by our university, we had to work quickly and omit the inclusion of certain features to make the deadlines. This helped us to stay focused on which feautures were most important.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                   <br><br><h4>Approach</h4>
                    <p> Our methodology was largely guided by two books that were taught as part of the course: <em>The UX Book</em> by Hartson &amp; Pyla and Sketching <em>User Experiences: The Workbook</em> by Greenberg and authors.
                     <br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/UX-Book-Guidelines-Ensuring-Experience/dp/0123852412">The UX Book </a>takes a user-centred design approach to the entire UX design lifecycle. In the book, Hartson describes how to approach usability problems by gaining insight into the work roles and tasks within a domain. These insights are achieved by conducting a contextual inquiry and analysis to build a list of system requirements, and design-informing models. This forms the basis for a subsequent continuous cycle of designing, testing, and evaluating that comes together into UX lifecycle template called the Wheel (below).This template was the basis of the overall structure of this project.

                     <br><br><img src="wheel.png" width="500" class="img-responsive center-block">

                     <br><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sketching-User-Experiences-Saul-Greenberg/dp/0123819598">Sketching the User Experience: The Workbook</a> helped guide our approach to coming up with design ideas, in the form of sketching. The book approaches sketching as a way to generate, draft and communicate ideas without being limited by tools and to encourage a continuous and iterative process. This iterative process is part of Stuart Pugh’s (1990) “Design Funnel”, that argues for the generation and convergence of ideas, with the process gradually converging to a final concept. The iterative design stages of the funnel communicate that the designer generates and reduces ideas until resolution.

                    </p>
                    <br><h4>Research &amp; findings</h4>
                    <p>Our research consisted of observations and in-depth interviews with participants who matched our user base. This included shoppers and shop owners who owned smart phones.
                        <br><br>These methods were designed to learn as much about the domain of the intended user base <em>without</em> our proposed system. This involved observing shoppers' actions as they searched for an item in St Andrews, and observing shop owners manage and sell inventory.</p>
                        <br><h5>Insights</h5>
                        <p>Our investigation into the domain helped us elicit many insights into the work domain.
                            <br><br>For shoppers:
                    </p>
                     <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                        <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>SHOW ME WHAT I WANT.</strong> Shoppers have preferences in the platform, the filtering options and discovery when they are searching for an item. They expect to be able to find items on either desktop or mobile, to be able to refine the search by a set of specifications and also leave part of the search process to discovery (browsing).</li>
                             <li><strong>BRAND RECOGNITION &amp; TRUST.</strong> Shoppers base their purchasing decisions on trust and preference, looking for brands with an established reputation or basing their choices on recommendations.</li>
                             <li><strong>ACCURATE &amp; UPDATED INFORMATION.</strong> A pain point for users was out-of-date directories or information. Additionally, if shoppers cannot discern the hours or location of the shop, it is likely that they will not visit the shop.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <br><p>For shop owners:</p>

                <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                        <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>FAMILIAR PROCESS.</strong> Shop owners have a very specific process and set of needs while keeping track of store inventory, usually through a desktop platform that integrates with an automated point-of-sale system. The stock-taking process is divided into how they take stock and how they deliver items.</li>
                             <li><strong>INDUSTRY CHANGES.</strong> Shop owner's needs for managing inventory differ based on domain and the seasonality of some products.</li>
                             <li><strong>SELLING INVENTORY.</strong> To market to their customers, shop owners use a range of marketing tools. The tools are specific to the interaction they are trying to achieve, which varies with each business domain.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                </div>
                <br><br><h5>Illustrating user scenarios</h5>
                <p>To better communicate our solution and understand its purpose, the team sketched various scenarios for pain points that arose during our research. Below shows a scenario I sketched of a participant not being able to find a business due to inaccurate listing information.</p>
                    
                <img src="scenario.png" width="600" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="scenario sketch">
                <br><br><p>Scenarios were sketched to illustrate point points that exist within the shopping domain and then sketched again to illustrate how Peruse could solve the paint points (below).</p>
                  <img src="scenario2.png" width="600" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="scenario sketch">

                    <br><br><h4>Designing the system</h4>
                    <p>The design phase was guided by the pain points, or problems, identified in the research. The team therefore set out to come up with as many solutions as possible for the problems Peruse should solve. This included solutions that took both a conservative and out-of-the-box approach.
                        <br><br>For instance, a solution I proposed for inaccurate listing information was either to indicate to the user when the listing was last updated (conservative) or have a mail and telephone verification system (out-of-the-box). (Illustrated below)</p>

                        <img src="sketch2.png" width="600" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="scenario sketch">
                    <br><p>After the team synced up the designs for the solutions, we began prototyping at a low-fidelity. This involved creating a smartphone out of foam board and using a strip of paper with the different mobile screens to simulate interaction.
                    <br><br>Prototyping continued with creating elements in Sketch and transfering the screens to InVision for a more high-fidelity interaction. This helped prepare us for our presentation to our client, where I animated the app in Keynote for more accurate element-based interaction (see gif below).

                    <h4>Final solution</h4>
                    <p>The final solution I designed for the shopper app includes features that offer a solution to the major pain points discovered in our research, including:</p>

                        <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>PRODUCT SEARCH.</strong> Shoppers are able to search for any kind of product in the main search bar. The system will accommodate different terms with suggested search terms.</li>
                             <li><strong>PRODUCT BROWSE.</strong> The app allows shoppers to browse by viewing large thumnails of the item with information about its distance and price.</li>
                             <li><strong>FILTERING RESULTS.</strong> Shoppers are able to filter their results by distance, price, category, colour, etc. They can also choose to exclude certain terms if the results are too inaccurate.</li>
                             <li><strong>BUSINESS INFORMATION.</strong> Shoppers can view all business information from a product page. This information includes contact information, location, hours, and social media.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>CURATION.</strong> Shoppers can save items they like to their "heart list" in order to quickly retrieve them at a later time.
